    "For the longest time, I've kept notes locally on Apple Pages. To that end, I have no complaints. Pages is an amazing piece of software that allows you to quickly produce high quality documents (with really great diagrams and tables) in a fraction of the time it would take on Overleaf, Word or Google Docs.\n",

    "\n",
    "`jupyter_to_medium` is a Python package that allows you to directly deploy your Jupyter Notebook articles to Medium. This is useful if you typically base most of your articles on content from Jupyter Notebooks. I've been curious about this package for a while, but I've only just gotten round to experimenting with it... let's see what it can do! If things go well I may strongly consider using it as the main source of my articles.\n",
