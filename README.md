# test-jupyter-book
Repository for testing out jupyter-book and jupyter_to_medium

## Instructions to reproduce

Preliminaries:
- Make sure that you have activated GitHub pages on your account. For more information, please visit: [GitHub Pages Tutorial](https://pages.github.com)


First, create a new GitHub repository. Let's call this `your_project_name` for the purposes of this tutorial.

Then on your local terminal, make sure you have the latest version of cookiecutter, `pip install -U cookiecutter` and of jupyter-book, `pip install -U jupyter-book`.

Run `cookiecutter git@github.com:executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book.git` and answer the questions given.

Now a folder is created that has the name of the book name that you chose. Within this, you have the important files that make up the book. Copy all the files in this folder into your local repository (make sure that `.github` is also copied).

Then, push your project to GitHub!
